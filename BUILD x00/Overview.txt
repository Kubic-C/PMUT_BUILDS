PMUT, Build(x00)

discord server -> https://discord.gg/maEbuVQ

"bugs were made, bugs were fixed."

This is a pre-released build, there WILL be some bugs.
If any are found please report them to the discord server. thank you!

What are the changes!

1. completly revised PMUT-CS(PMUT's command system)
so the way commands are typed are different

a. instead of arguments there are options

b. command names now have to be wrapped in curly
brackets AKA command extractor operators

2. minor fixes and optimizations 

Any other plans for this pre-release build?

Yes in fact! Commands when called will be put on
their own thread to prevent slowing down the renderer

I plan to add settings to PMUT so things like
the swap interval, and background info can be
saved without having to constantly change them
everytime you boot up PMUT.

What are the plans for the build after this?

The majority of the networking features will
be added back, I had to remove them since
they were dependent on ms windows. So the new
networking library is ASIO standalone(not boost
dependent).
