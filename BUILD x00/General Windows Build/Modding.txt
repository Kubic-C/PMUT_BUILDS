modding PMUT?

although to the extent to which you can mod PMUT is limited,
there is still some stuff to mod.

What can I mod?

so far you can change the bitmap that PMUT uses,
the font shader(GPU program), and the ICON of PMUT.

some tips!:

1. When changing PMUT's font files remember they need to
be named PMUT_FONT, before you start swapping out
fonts keep in mind that having oversized characters WILL
end up in weird rendering things happening(characters going
offscreen, colliding with other characters, etc.).
Here is the bitmap generator: https://libgdx.badlogicgames.com/nightlies/runnables/runnable-hiero.jar
Also if you ever get stuck on why it is not
working look at PMUT's default font files.

2. When changing PMUT's font shaders keep in mind that
PMUT uses batch rendering which in other words, means
that it renders everything in one go, also the lines
that start with '@' are the names of the shader program.
So changing them will result in PMUT not knowing where
the programs are, so don't change them.
