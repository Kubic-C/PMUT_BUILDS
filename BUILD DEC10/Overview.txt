"bugs were made, bugs were fixed."

What are the changes!

1. all commands are now called
on a seperate to improve rendering 
time slightly for commands that take
longer to execute.

2. added some keyboard shortcuts for
quality of life.

3.made some other minor fixes

What are the plans for the build after this?

The majority of the networking features will
be added back, I had to remove them since
they were dependent on ms windows. So the new
networking library is ASIO standalone(not boost
dependent).
