discord server -> https://discord.gg/maEbuVQ

x, y, or z, is where you want your arguments to be
for example:
"{print} [str:x]" -> "{print} [str:Hello world]"

general commands:

"{exit}": this will exit the console

"{info}": this will print some info about going to this file and also show the discord link

"{print} [str:x]": this will print a singular static string of characters

"{print two} [str:x] [str2:y]": this will print two static string of characters on different lines

rendering commands:

"{swap interval} [i:x]" : 
this sets the swap interval, higher numbers means less frames
lower numbers means more frames, the lowest you can go is 0(this makes the GPU go usage go crazy).
The default is 2. put the number you want where x is!
