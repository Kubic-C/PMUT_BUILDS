"bugs were made, bugs were fixed."

This the first release of OpenGL PMUT, their will be some slight
unintended behavior. If you find a bug or something that seems
off report it to the discord server.

Where in the hell is the network library?

Rewriting it to make it more cross-platform
friendly. :(

What are the conversion thingys?

when passing a argument to a function
you need the argument and the conversion type.
for example:

print -a[ Hello World{string}]

will output into the console with:

Hello World

So how does the console work?

The console itself uses batch rendering with
a correlating text output buffer. The text out-
put buffer itself is made up of a strings
with a output wrapper, so the string can
be a permanent string, static string, or
a non-static string.

permanent strings, only have to be added once
to the output buffer and can never be cleared from
the screen. Strings like the PMUT name and opengl context.

static strings, only have to be added once,
however can be cleared by pressing the F1 key.
Strings like the output in the console

non-static strings, have to be added to the
output buffer every frame. For example
like the "frame time" string is a non-static
string.
